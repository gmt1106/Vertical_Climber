# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 18, 2026

## Mountain Goat

This privacy policy describes how Mountain Goat ("the App") handles user data.

## Data Collection

The App itself does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Game data such as your best distance score is stored locally on your device using SharedPreferences and is never sent to any server.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses **Google AdMob** to display advertisements. Google AdMob may collect and use data in accordance with Google's privacy policy. This may include:

- Device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID)
- IP address
- General location data
- App usage and interaction data

For more information on how Google handles data, please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

## Children's Privacy

The App is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Google AdMob may serve personalized or non-personalized ads depending on user consent and regional regulations.

## Data Security

Since the App does not collect or transmit personal data, there is no user data stored on external servers. All game progress is stored locally on your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
